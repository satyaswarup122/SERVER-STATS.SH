This project provides a simple shell script *server-stats.sh* that analyzes basic server performance statistics on any Linux system.  
It helps system administrators quickly monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and identify the top resource-consuming processes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
The script displays:
- *Total CPU usage*
- *Total Memory usage* (Free vs Used, including percentage)
- *Total Disk usage* (Free vs Used, including percentage)
- *Top 5 processes by CPU usage*
- *Top 5 processes by Memory usage*

### ðŸ”§ Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)
- OS version
- Uptime
- Load average
- Logged-in users
- Failed login attempts

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Follow these steps to run the script:

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/server-stats.git
   cd server-stats

## RUN IN COMMAND LINE

chmod +x server-stats.sh

./server-stats.sh

bash server-stats.sh

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
==== Server Performance Stats ====

CPU Usage: 12.5%

Memory Usage: 2.3G / 8G (28.7%)

Disk Usage (/): 15G / 100G (15%)

Top 5 Processes by CPU:
  PID   USER   %CPU   COMMAND
  1024  root    25    python3
  2089  user    12    chrome

Top 5 Processes by Memory:
  PID   USER   %MEM   COMMAND
